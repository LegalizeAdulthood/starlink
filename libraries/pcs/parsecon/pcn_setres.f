*+
*  Name:
*     PARSECON_SETRES

*  Purpose:
*     Set flag indicating RANGE or IN restrictions.

*  Language:
*     VAX Fortran

*  Invocation:
*     CALL PARSECON_SETRES ( FLAG, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     Sets the flag indicating whether the constraints being defined for
*     the most-recently declared paramater are for RANGE or IN.

*  Arguments:
